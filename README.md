# HistopathologyResearch-

Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) is one of the most common breast cancer diseases, accounting for around 80% of all breast cancer diagnoses. There are four stages of IDC and at the final stage the cancer spreads to other parts of the body. However, if the cancer is detected in its early stages (1-2) the tumor may be safely removed. Currently, histopathologists spend hours compiling whole slides and filtering between cancerous patches. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we can automate the jobs of histopathologists and locate areas of cancer faster in the tissue. We trained such a model on a recently published breast cancer dataset, and it attained a 91.6% training accuracy and a 90.5% test accuracy. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61490841/193900642-a3e5a229-b896-4918-bb46-cb67d2074a8a.png)
